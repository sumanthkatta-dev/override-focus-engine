> **The Attention Firewall:** A browser extension that performs surgical DOM manipulation to remove addictive "Variable Reward" loops (Reels, Shorts) without blocking the entire site.

## 🖼️ Impact: Before vs. After

### ❌ Before (Distracted)

*(Standard Interface: Cluttered with addictive Shorts shelf and sidebar recommendations)*

### ✅ After (Focused)

*(Override Enabled: Distraction vectors surgically removed; core utility remains intact)*

## 🚨 The Problem: Algorithmic Fragmentation
Social media platforms use **Variable Reward Schedules** to fragment user attention. For professionals who use LinkedIn or YouTube for research, it is nearly impossible to avoid "doom-scrolling" traps like Shorts or Infinite Feeds, leading to significant lost work hours.

## 🛡️ The Solution
Unlike standard blockers that ban an entire domain, **Override** parses the HTML and selectively removes only the distraction vectors while keeping the utility intact.

1.  **Surgical Removal:** Uses CSS injection to hide distraction vectors (`ytd-rich-shelf-renderer`, `Reels Container`) before they render.
2.  **Active Monitoring:** A `MutationObserver` watches for dynamic content loading (SPAs) and kills distractions instantly.
3.  **Focus Protocol:** A state-managed toggle lets you enable/disable the firewall based on your current workflow.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
* **Chrome Extension Manifest V3**
* **Advanced CSS Selectors** (`display: none !important`)
* **JavaScript MutationObserver API** (For SPA changes)
* **Chrome Storage API** (State Management)
